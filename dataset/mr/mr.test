0	the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .
0	staggeringly dreadful romance .
0	there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where 's the movie here ?
0	too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
1	high on melodrama . but it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
0	this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
1	an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them .
1	an absurdist spider web .

1	i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest .
0	the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
1	an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre .
1	the beauty of alexander payne 's ode to the everyman is in the details .
1	it 's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .
0	even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
0	if hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clich� .
1	a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies .
0	don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) .
1	the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups .
0	eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal .
1	. . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original .
1	if you 're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you .
0	it 's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped �em together here .
1	an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake .
0	although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
1	these are lives worth watching , paths worth following .
1	a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the `` a `` range , as is , it 's a very very strong `` b+ . `` i love the robust middle of this picture .
0	any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
1	at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson 's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts .
0	to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .
1	a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
0	although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .
1	watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .
1	it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .
1	it 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro .

1	the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him .
0	'synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .
0	there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
0	comedy troupe broken lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot .
0	this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away .
1	it 's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self .
0	solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh 's best films , `` erin brockovich , `` `` out of sight `` and `` ocean 's eleven , `` never were .
0	. . . post-september 11 , `` the sum of all fears `` seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
1	not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again .
0	most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
1	a taut , sobering film .

0	the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
1	a delirious celebration of the female orgasm .
1	it 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .
1	a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing .
1	none of his actors stand out , but that 's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere .
0	a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
0	it would n't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .
1	the film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects .

1	it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .
1	`` white oleander , `` the movie , is akin to a reader 's digest condensed version of the source material .
1	if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy 's stand-up act .
1	the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .
